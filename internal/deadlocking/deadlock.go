// SimpleDeadLock demonstrates a very basic `deadlockâ€œ scenario.
// The go runtime will actually protect us from some types of
// deadlocking scenarios (this is outlined in runtime protections)
//
// In this case, two goroutines are spawned, each battling over the same
// locks, slightly out of order.  This causes both routines to be blocked
// and the goruntime will detect and panic with a fatal error
//
// fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
//
// the sum function will attempt to lock v1.m and then v2.m
// the additional goroutine (also running sum) will attempt to
// lock v2.m and then v1.m
// This creates a scenario where v1 is locked, trying to lock v2
// v2 is locked, trying to lock v1
// Neither will concede control and both remain blocked indefinitely.
//
// The `Coffman Conditions` are outlined in the documentation for areas
// which are meeting all (4) of it's checks.
//
// Again of note, it is critical to understand that in most cases this will
// deadlock, it is still possible that the first invocation of sum() finishes
// before the second one is even invoked/switched too by the runtime scheduler.
// This demonstrates the complexity of getting concurrent code correct.
